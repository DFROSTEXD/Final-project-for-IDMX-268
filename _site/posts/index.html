                <h3>Fortnite</h3>
                <div class="review-meta">
                    <span class="date">December 12, 2025</span>
                    <span class="category">Personal</span>
                    <span class="rating">★★★★☆ 8.5/10</span>
                </div>
                <div class="review-content">
                    <p>Fortnite has transcended the battle royale genre to become a cultural phenomenon. What started as a unique take on the last-player-standing formula has evolved into a constantly changing platform that blends gaming, social interaction, and entertainment in unprecedented ways.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Core Gameplay</h4>
                    <p>The building mechanic is what sets Fortnite apart from its competitors. Being able to harvest materials and construct defensive structures or strategic vantage points adds a layer of creativity and skill expression that rewards quick thinking and adaptability. The shooting mechanics are accessible yet have depth for those who want to master them.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Seasons and Content</h4>
                    <p>Epic Games' commitment to regular content updates keeps the game fresh. Each season brings new themes, map changes, weapons, and challenges. Collaborations with popular franchises—from Marvel to Star Wars—create unique crossover moments that make each season feel like an event.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Accessibility</h4>
                    <p>Fortnite's free-to-play model and cross-platform support make it incredibly accessible. You can play with friends regardless of whether they're on PC, console, or mobile. The game's colorful art style runs well on a variety of hardware, ensuring a broad player base.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Social Experience</h4>
                    <p>Beyond the battle royale mode, Fortnite has become a social platform. Creative mode allows players to build custom game modes and experiences, while events like in-game concerts have pushed the boundaries of what a "game" can be.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Criticisms</h4>
                    <p>The aggressive monetization of cosmetics can feel predatory, especially given the game's young audience. The meta can shift dramatically with updates, sometimes frustrating players who've invested time mastering certain strategies. The skill ceiling for building can also be intimidating for newcomers.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Verdict</h4>
                    <p>Fortnite is more than just a game—it's a constantly evolving platform that has redefined what a live-service game can be. While it has its flaws, the core experience remains engaging, accessible, and culturally relevant.</p>

            <!-- Destiny 2 Full Review -->
            <article id="destiny2-review" class="full-review">
                <h3>Destiny 2</h3>
                <div class="review-meta">
                    <span class="date">December 8, 2025</span>
                    <span class="category">Guides</span>
                    <span class="rating">★★★★☆ 8.7/10</span>
                </div>
                <div class="review-content">
                    <p>Destiny 2 is Bungie's ambitious sci-fi looter shooter that blends MMO elements with tight gunplay and spectacular set pieces. As a Guardian defending humanity's last city, you'll explore planets, complete strikes, raid alien strongholds, and compete in PvP arenas.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Gunplay and Combat</h4>
                    <p>This is where Destiny 2 truly shines. The shooting mechanics are some of the best in the industry—precise, satisfying, and varied. Each weapon class feels distinct, and the game offers hundreds of unique weapons with different perks to chase. Your Guardian's abilities and subclasses add layers of strategy, allowing for diverse playstyles.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Content Variety</h4>
                    <p>From story campaigns to strikes, raids, dungeons, and seasonal activities, there's no shortage of things to do. Raids are particular highlights—six-player challenges that require coordination, communication, and skill. These elaborate encounters with mechanics-heavy boss fights provide some of gaming's most rewarding experiences.</p>
                    
                    <h4>The World</h4>
                    <p>Destiny 2's universe is rich with lore and stunning visuals. Locations range from the European Dead Zone to the mystical Dreaming City, each with its own aesthetic and secrets to uncover. The art direction is consistently impressive, with otherworldly vistas and detailed enemy designs.</p>
                    
                    <h4>The Grind</h4>
                    <p>As a looter shooter, grinding for better gear is core to the experience. The pursuit of god-rolled weapons and high-stat armor can be addictive, though it occasionally feels repetitive. The seasonal model keeps fresh content flowing but can lead to FOMO (fear of missing out) if you can't play regularly.</p>
                    
                    <h4>New Player Experience</h4>
                    <p>Destiny 2's biggest weakness is its onboarding. The game does a poor job of explaining its systems to newcomers, and the sheer amount of content can be overwhelming. The story has been fractured by vaulted content, making it hard for new players to understand the narrative.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Verdict</h4>
                    <p>Destiny 2 offers some of the best shooting mechanics in gaming wrapped in a beautiful sci-fi universe. While the new player experience and seasonal model have issues, the core gameplay loop and endgame content make it a rewarding experience for those willing to invest the time.</p>

            <!-- Rainbow Six Siege Full Review -->
            <article id="rainbow6-review" class="full-review">
                <h3>Rainbow Six Siege</h3>
                <div class="review-meta">
                    <span class="date">December 1, 2025</span>
                    <span class="category">Tech</span>
                    <span class="rating">★★★★☆ 8.8/10</span>
                </div>
                <div class="review-content">
                    <p>Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical first-person shooter that emphasizes strategy, teamwork, and environmental destruction. Unlike most modern shooters, Siege rewards patience, communication, and intelligent play over twitch reflexes alone.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Tactical Gameplay</h4>
                    <p>Every round in Siege is a tense chess match. Attackers must breach and clear while defenders fortify and ambush. The preparation phase where defenders reinforce walls and set up gadgets, combined with the attackers' use of drones to gather intel, creates strategic depth rarely seen in multiplayer shooters.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Operators and Gadgets</h4>
                    <p>With over 60 operators, each with unique gadgets and abilities, the game offers incredible variety. From Thermite's exothermic charges that breach reinforced walls to Pulse's heartbeat sensor for detecting enemies through surfaces, each operator enables different strategies. Learning operator synergies and counters is key to mastery.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Destruction System</h4>
                    <p>The partially destructible environments are central to Siege's identity. Walls can be breached, floors can be destroyed, and sightlines can be created anywhere. This makes every round unpredictable and rewards creative thinking. No two rounds play exactly the same way.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Learning Curve</h4>
                    <p>Siege has a steep learning curve. Map knowledge is crucial—knowing common angles, rotation holes, and objective locations takes time. The one-life-per-round format means mistakes are punishing, which can be frustrating for newcomers but rewarding once you improve.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Community and Support</h4>
                    <p>Ubisoft has supported Siege for years with regular content updates, new operators, maps, and balancing changes. The competitive scene is thriving, with a dedicated esports league. However, the game's toxicity can be an issue, with teamkilling and smurfing affecting the experience.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Technical Issues</h4>
                    <p>While improved over the years, Siege still suffers from occasional bugs and questionable hit registration. Server issues can disrupt matches, and cheating remains a problem at higher ranks despite anti-cheat efforts.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Verdict</h4>
                    <p>Rainbow Six Siege stands out in a sea of shooters by prioritizing tactics and teamwork. Its unique destruction system and diverse operators create emergent gameplay that keeps matches fresh. While the learning curve is steep and technical issues persist, the rewarding gameplay loop makes it a standout competitive shooter.</p>

            <!-- Overwatch 2 Full Review -->
            <article id="overwatch2-review" class="full-review">
                <h3>Overwatch 2</h3>
                <div class="review-meta">
                    <span class="date">November 28, 2025</span>
                    <span class="category">Esports</span>
                    <span class="rating">★★★☆☆ 7.5/10</span>
                </div>
                <div class="review-content">
                    <p>Overwatch 2 is Blizzard's sequel to their popular hero shooter, transitioning to a free-to-play model while introducing new heroes, maps, and a shift from 6v6 to 5v5 gameplay. While it brings some improvements, the sequel also raises questions about whether it deserved to replace the original.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Gameplay Changes</h4>
                    <p>The move to 5v5 (removing one tank per team) fundamentally changes how Overwatch plays. Matches feel faster and more aggressive, with individual plays having greater impact. Tanks have been reworked to be more self-sufficient, which helps offset the loss of a second tank but changes team dynamics considerably.</p>
                    
                    <h4>New Heroes</h4>
                    <p>New heroes like Sojourn, Junker Queen, and Kiriko add fresh playstyles to the roster. Their abilities feel impactful and well-designed, though locking new heroes behind battle pass progression (even temporarily) has been controversial. The hero balance has improved with more frequent updates.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Maps and Modes</h4>
                    <p>New maps showcase Blizzard's continued excellence in level design, with varied environments that encourage different strategies. The new Push mode is interesting but hasn't quite captured the magic of classic modes like Payload and Control. Some original maps have been reworked to better suit 5v5 play.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Free-to-Play Model</h4>
                    <p>The transition to free-to-play makes the game more accessible, but the monetization feels aggressive. The battle pass system, expensive cosmetics, and removal of loot boxes have been divisive. Players can no longer earn all cosmetics through gameplay, which feels like a step backward from the original.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Missing Features</h4>
                    <p>The promised PvE content that was supposed to be a centerpiece of Overwatch 2 has been scaled back significantly, disappointing many fans who were excited for story missions. Some features from Overwatch 1, like certain game modes and maps, were missing at launch.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Performance and Presentation</h4>
                    <p>Graphical improvements, while subtle, make the game look cleaner and run better on most systems. The UI has been updated with mixed results—some elements are improved while others feel less intuitive than before.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Verdict</h4>
                    <p>Overwatch 2 offers refined, fast-paced hero shooter action with some meaningful improvements over its predecessor. However, aggressive monetization, missing PvE content, and the controversial replacement of the original game make it hard to fully recommend. It's still fun to play, especially with friends, but feels more like a major update than a true sequel.</p>
