            <p>Overwatch 2 is Blizzard's sequel to their popular hero shooter, transitioning to a free-to-play model while introducing new heroes, maps, and a shift from 6v6 to 5v5 gameplay. While it brings some improvements, the sequel also raises questions about whether it deserved to replace the original.</p>
<h2>Gameplay changes</h2>
<p>The move to 5v5 (removing one tank per team) fundamentally changes how Overwatch plays. Matches feel faster and more aggressive, with individual plays having greater impact. Tanks have been reworked to be more self-sufficient, which helps offset the loss of a second tank but changes team dynamics considerably.</p>
<h2>New heroes</h2>
<p>New heroes like Sojourn, Junker Queen, and Kiriko add fresh playstyles to the roster. Their abilities feel impactful and well-designed, though locking new heroes behind battle pass progression (even temporarily) has been controversial. The hero balance has improved with more frequent updates.</p>
<h2>Maps and modes</h2>
<p>New maps showcase Blizzard's continued excellence in level design, with varied environments that encourage different strategies. The new Push mode is interesting but hasn't quite captured the magic of classic modes like Payload and Control. Some original maps have been reworked to better suit 5v5 play.</p>
<h2>Free-to-play model</h2>
<p>The transition to free-to-play makes the game more accessible, but the monetization feels aggressive. The battle pass system, expensive cosmetics, and removal of loot boxes have been divisive. Players can no longer earn all cosmetics through gameplay, which feels like a step backward from the original.</p>
<h2>Missing features</h2>
<p>The promised PvE content that was supposed to be a centerpiece of Overwatch 2 has been scaled back significantly, disappointing many fans who were excited for story missions. Some features from Overwatch 1, like certain game modes and maps, were missing at launch.</p>
<h2>Performance and presentation</h2>
<p>Graphical improvements, while subtle, make the game look cleaner and run better on most systems. The UI has been updated with mixed results—some elements are improved while others feel less intuitive than before.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Overwatch 2 offers refined, fast-paced hero shooter action with some meaningful improvements over its predecessor. However, aggressive monetization, missing PvE content, and the controversial replacement of the original game make it hard to fully recommend. It's still fun to play, especially with friends, but feels more like a major update than a true sequel.</p>
