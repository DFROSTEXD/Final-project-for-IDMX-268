            <p>Destiny 2 is Bungie's ambitious sci-fi looter shooter that blends MMO elements with tight gunplay and spectacular set pieces. As a Guardian defending humanity's last city, you'll explore planets, complete strikes, raid alien strongholds, and compete in PvP arenas.</p>
<h2>Gunplay and combat</h2>
<p>This is where Destiny 2 truly shines. The shooting mechanics are some of the best in the industry—precise, satisfying, and varied. Each weapon class feels distinct, and the game offers hundreds of unique weapons with different perks to chase. Your Guardian's abilities and subclasses add layers of strategy, allowing for diverse playstyles.</p>
<h2>Content variety</h2>
<p>From story campaigns to strikes, raids, dungeons, and seasonal activities, there's no shortage of things to do. Raids are particular highlights—six-player challenges that require coordination, communication, and skill. These elaborate encounters with mechanics-heavy boss fights provide some of gaming's most rewarding experiences.</p>
<h2>The world</h2>
<p>Destiny 2's universe is rich with lore and stunning visuals. Locations range from the European Dead Zone to the mystical Dreaming City, each with its own aesthetic and secrets to uncover. The art direction is consistently impressive, with otherworldly vistas and detailed enemy designs.</p>
<h2>The grind</h2>
<p>As a looter shooter, grinding for better gear is core to the experience. The pursuit of god-rolled weapons and high-stat armor can be addictive, though it occasionally feels repetitive. The seasonal model keeps fresh content flowing but can lead to FOMO (fear of missing out) if you can't play regularly.</p>
<h2>New player experience</h2>
<p>Destiny 2's biggest weakness is its onboarding. The game does a poor job of explaining its systems to newcomers, and the sheer amount of content can be overwhelming. The story has been fractured by vaulted content, making it hard for new players to understand the narrative.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Destiny 2 offers some of the best shooting mechanics in gaming wrapped in a beautiful sci-fi universe. While the new player experience and seasonal model have issues, the core gameplay loop and endgame content make it a rewarding experience for those willing to invest the time.</p>
