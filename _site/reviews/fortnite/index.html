            <p>Fortnite has transcended the battle royale genre to become a cultural phenomenon. What started as a unique take on the last-player-standing formula has evolved into a constantly changing platform that blends gaming, social interaction, and entertainment in unprecedented ways.</p>
<h2>Core gameplay</h2>
<p>The building mechanic is what sets Fortnite apart from its competitors. Being able to harvest materials and construct defensive structures or strategic vantage points adds a layer of creativity and skill expression that rewards quick thinking and adaptability. The shooting mechanics are accessible yet have depth for those who want to master them.</p>
<h2>Seasons and content</h2>
<p>Epic Games' commitment to regular content updates keeps the game fresh. Each season brings new themes, map changes, weapons, and challenges. Collaborations with popular franchises—from Marvel to Star Wars—create unique crossover moments that make each season feel like an event.</p>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>Fortnite's free-to-play model and cross-platform support make it incredibly accessible. You can play with friends regardless of whether they're on PC, console, or mobile. The game's colorful art style runs well on a variety of hardware, ensuring a broad player base.</p>
<h2>Social experience</h2>
<p>Beyond the battle royale mode, Fortnite has become a social platform. Creative mode allows players to build custom game modes and experiences, while events like in-game concerts have pushed the boundaries of what a &quot;game&quot; can be.</p>
<h2>Criticisms</h2>
<p>The aggressive monetization of cosmetics can feel predatory, especially given the game's young audience. The meta can shift dramatically with updates, sometimes frustrating players who've invested time mastering certain strategies. The skill ceiling for building can also be intimidating for newcomers.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Fortnite is more than just a game—it's a constantly evolving platform that has redefined what a live-service game can be. While it has its flaws, the core experience remains engaging, accessible, and culturally relevant.</p>
