            <p>Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical first-person shooter that emphasizes strategy, teamwork, and environmental destruction. Unlike most modern shooters, Siege rewards patience, communication, and intelligent play over twitch reflexes alone.</p>
<h2>Tactical gameplay</h2>
<p>Every round in Siege is a tense chess match. Attackers must breach and clear while defenders fortify and ambush. The preparation phase where defenders reinforce walls and set up gadgets, combined with the attackers' use of drones to gather intel, creates strategic depth rarely seen in multiplayer shooters.</p>
<h2>Operators and gadgets</h2>
<p>With over 60 operators, each with unique gadgets and abilities, the game offers incredible variety. From Thermite's exothermic charges that breach reinforced walls to Pulse's heartbeat sensor for detecting enemies through surfaces, each operator enables different strategies. Learning operator synergies and counters is key to mastery.</p>
<h2>Destruction system</h2>
<p>The partially destructible environments are central to Siege's identity. Walls can be breached, floors can be destroyed, and sightlines can be created anywhere. This makes every round unpredictable and rewards creative thinking. No two rounds play exactly the same way.</p>
<h2>Learning curve</h2>
<p>Siege has a steep learning curve. Map knowledge is crucial—knowing common angles, rotation holes, and objective locations takes time. The one-life-per-round format means mistakes are punishing, which can be frustrating for newcomers but rewarding once you improve.</p>
<h2>Community and support</h2>
<p>Ubisoft has supported Siege for years with regular content updates, new operators, maps, and balancing changes. The competitive scene is thriving, with a dedicated esports league. However, the game's toxicity can be an issue, with teamkilling and smurfing affecting the experience.</p>
<h2>Technical issues</h2>
<p>While improved over the years, Siege still suffers from occasional bugs and questionable hit registration. Server issues can disrupt matches, and cheating remains a problem at higher ranks despite anti-cheat efforts.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege stands out in a sea of shooters by prioritizing tactics and teamwork. Its unique destruction system and diverse operators create emergent gameplay that keeps matches fresh. While the learning curve is steep and technical issues persist, the rewarding gameplay loop makes it a standout competitive shooter.</p>
